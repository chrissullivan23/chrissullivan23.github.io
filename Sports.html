<h2>New England Patriots</h2>
<p>The New England Patriots are an NFL franchise based out of Foxboro Massachusetts.I have been a fan of the Patriots ever since I was born,The reason being is because my dad and older brother were fans, and I grew up watching games with them. My favorite player of all time is Tom Brady, the Patriots have 5 super bowl wins which is tied for second among all other franchises. <p/>
