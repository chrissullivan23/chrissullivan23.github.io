<H1>My hobbies</H1>
<body>
<p>Some of my favorite things to do in my spare time are fishing playing basketball and playing video games.Being in college as a full time student has made doing these activities much harder because I am always busy with either schoolwork or other commitments.I still do enjoy going to the gym in campus and playing basketball,but I do not have my car up here so living off campus and getting to the gym is a tough task.I am a native of Cape Cod Massachusetts so in the Summertime I do enjoy to fish when I am not working. I also enjoy playing videogames when I have some downtime, my favorite games are Madden NFL football 19 and NBA 2k 19.</p>
