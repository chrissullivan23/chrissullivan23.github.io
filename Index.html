Hi there, welcome to my webpage I am a Junior at the University of Maine Orono. I am a marketing major studying at the Maine business school, I am from Cape Cod Massachusetts. I enjoy hanging with my friends working out,playing with my dog and playing and watching sports.

<P>I chose marketing as my major because I really enjoy the idea of thing of new and unique ways to advertise products and services to the consuming audience. When I get out of school and graduate I hope to be a marketing advisor at a sports firm.<p/>
